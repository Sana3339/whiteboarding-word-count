"""Count words in a sentence, and print in ascending order.

For example::

    >>> word_count("berry cherry cherry cherry berry apple")
    apple: 1
    berry: 2
    cherry: 3

If there is a tie for a count, make sure the words are printed in
ascending order within the tie::

    >>> word_count("hey hi hello")
    hello: 1
    hey: 1

Capitalized words are considered distinct::

    >>> word_count("hi Hi hi")
    Hi: 1
